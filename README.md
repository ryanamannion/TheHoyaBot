# TheHoyaBot

This Twitter Bot tweets out article titles generated by an n-gram generator trained on titles from The Hoya, Georgetown's student newspaper.
The titles were scraped from [The Hoya's online archive](https://thehoya.com/), which goes back to 1998.
The n-gram generator was adapted from code provided in an intro NLP course by Amir Zeldes.
The Twitter Bot uses Molly White's twitter bot framework provided [here](http://blog.mollywhite.net/how-to-create-a-twitter-bot/)

For a more detail on how and why I built this, check out the [write-up on my website](https://sites.google.com/view/ryanamannion/projects/nlp-twitter-bot-project)
