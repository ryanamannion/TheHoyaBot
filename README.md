This Twitter Bot tweets out article titles generated by an n-gram generator trained on titles from The Hoya, Georgetown's student Newspaper.
The titles were scraped from The Hoya's online archive, which goes back to 1998. It is available at www.thehoya.com
The n-gram generator was adapted from code provided in an intro NLP course by Amir Zeldes.
The Twitter Bot uses Molly White's twitter bot framework provided here: http://blog.mollywhite.net/how-to-create-a-twitter-bot/
